# Privacy Policy for ShoptOut

**Last Updated: November 16, 2025**

## Introduction

ShoptOut ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Safari extension handles information when you use ShoptOut.

## Information We Collect

**We do NOT collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information.**

ShoptOut operates entirely locally on your device and does not:
- Collect any personal data
- Track your browsing history
- Transmit data to external servers
- Use cookies or tracking technologies
- Store information outside your device

## How ShoptOut Works

ShoptOut is a browser extension that:
1. Detects pre-selected marketing opt-in checkboxes on shopping websites
2. Automatically unchecks these checkboxes to protect your privacy
3. Stores only local preferences (extension on/off state and statistics counter) in your browser's local storage
4. Operates entirely within your browser without any external communication

## Data Storage

The only data stored by ShoptOut is:
- **Extension Settings**: Whether ShoptOut is enabled or disabled (stored locally on your device)
- **Statistics Counter**: Total number of checkboxes unchecked (stored locally on your device)

This data:
- Never leaves your device
- Is not accessible to us or any third parties
- Can be cleared by uninstalling the extension
- Is specific to your device only

## Third-Party Services

ShoptOut does NOT use any third-party services, analytics, or tracking tools.

## Children's Privacy

ShoptOut does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.

## Data Security

Since ShoptOut does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers, there is no risk of data breaches or unauthorized access to your information.

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect any personal data, there is no data for you to access, modify, or delete. You can completely remove all local data by uninstalling the ShoptOut extension.
