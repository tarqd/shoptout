# ShoptOut - Safari Extension

A Safari extension for iOS that automatically opts you out of newsletter subscriptions when shopping online.

- **Shopify** websites (detects checkboxes with ID "marketing_opt_in")
- **Squarespace** websites (detects checkboxes with name "subscribeCheckbox")

## How It Works

ShoptOut runs as a Safari Web Extension that:

1. Detects when you're on a supported e-commerce platform by checking for platform-specific global variables
2. Automatically finds newsletter subscription checkboxes
3. Unchecks them so you don't receive unwanted marketing emails
4. Detects if you checked the box yourself and let's you proceed if you like
